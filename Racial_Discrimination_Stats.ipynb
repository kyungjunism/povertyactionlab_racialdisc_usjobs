    "#### Of the provided test data, we found that the proportion of callbacks white sounding names getting callbacks from employers compared to black sounding names were 9.7% to 6.4% (a disparity of 3.3%). When we performed a Chi Squared Test to see if this difference was statistically significant, the resulting test statistic of 16.4 was larger than the critical value of 3.8, meaning that the difference was in fact statistically significant and that race did play a factor in employee callbacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Just how significant the impact was could not be measured and intersectionality does play a role in callbacks as well. Since we only isolated for the race and callback variables in the provided data, it is not certain just how significant the impact of race is callbacks."

Intersectionality between economic background, education, qualification, family, and a multitide of other factors can be present that determine job prospects for individuals. The analysis must qualify the statements' absolutes and wording should be wary of attributing one factor as the most important indicator of callback failure/success."
